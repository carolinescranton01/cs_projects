# Installing and using conda environments on the UA HPC

When using the HPC, it is important to be organized, so different ways to organize your work and programs have been created. The majority of bioinformatics programs are written in the programming language **python**, which is what we run on the HPC (however, other languages, like R, can be used). Within python, there is a distribuition called **anaconda**. This is a second layer of organization that helps all of the programs which you install and run work together and stay updated. Finally, the level of organization which we will be using most actively is called **conda** - conda is a package and environment manager, meaning when you install packages (different programs used in bioinformatics), it keeps them organized in what are called 'environments'. Many of the programs that we use rely on smaller, more universal programs - for example, an assembly program like metaSPADES requires many additional programs to run, called dependencies, which do things like organize the data, print out messages, and count files. When you install metaSPADES these are all automatically installed, so it isn't something to worry too much about (but is important when troubleshooting errors). When you install multiple complext programs in one conda environment, conda and anaconda work together to make sure that only one version of each dependency is installed so your environment isn't cluttered with many repeated programs and files.
