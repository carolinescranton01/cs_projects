# this script takes the compiled excel file (with new tabs for each sample) from the writeexcel.py script and creates a new spreadsheet which has columns Sheet_Name (sampleID), Gene_Name (the name of the antibiotic resistance gene), Gene_Function (the function of the gene), and Occurances (how many times that gene was found in that sample). This consolidated sheet was used for analysis in R.
